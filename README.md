# üõ†Ô∏è Multi-Tier Kubernetes App with Helm

This project demonstrates how to deploy a multi-tier application using **Helm charts** on a local **Minikube** cluster. It includes a Python-based backend, an NGINX frontend, test pods for internal communication, and optional network policies and ingress.

---

## üì¶ Project Structure

```bash
multi-tier-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chart.yaml               # Root Helm chart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ values.yaml              # Global default values
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ charts/                  # Subcharts for each component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/             # Backend chart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/            # Frontend chart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testbox-allow/       # Internal access pod (allowed)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testbox-deny/        # Internal access pod (denied)
```

#### Install Helm if not installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install helm

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install helm
```

## üîß Deploy with Helm

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewtonDevops/helm-multi-tier-app.git
cd helm-multi-tier-app
```

## Cleanup

Confirm that the previous deployments exist

```bash
kubectl get all
```
The output should be similar to this

``` pgsql
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

pod/testbox-allow-6f889c4dc6-hjnwr   1/1     Running   0          14m

deployment.apps/testbox-allow   1/1     1            1           14m

NAME                                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/backend-78b696fbd4         1         1         1       20m
replicaset.apps/frontend-79fd6696c         1         1         1       17m
replicaset.apps/testbox-allow-6f889c4dc6   1         1         1       14m

```

Delete all the deployments and services

```bash
  kubectl delete deployment backend frontend testbox-allow
  kubectl delete service backend frontend
```
Wait for a few seconds and reconfirm that you have deleted all the deployments and services

```bash
kubectl get all
```
Output should be similar to the below

```pgslq
No resources found in adv-net-lab namespace.
```

Install the chart:

```bash
helm install demo . 
```
Check deployed resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n adv-net-lab

```

## Additional Commands
```bash
# Install a chart named "multi-tier-app" from the current directory into namespace "adv-net-lab"
helm install multi-tier-app . -n adv-net-lab

# Upgrade the existing "multi-tier-app" release using values from values.yaml
helm upgrade multi-tier-app . -n adv-net-lab -f values.yaml

# Perform a dry run with debug output to preview the upgrade
helm upgrade multi-tier-app . -n adv-net-lab -f values.yaml --dry-run --debug

# List all Helm releases in namespace "adv-net-lab"
helm list -n adv-net-lab

# View the deployment history for rollback or auditing
helm history multi-tier-app -n adv-net-lab

# Rollback "multi-tier-app" to revision 1 in "adv-net-lab" namespace
helm rollback multi-tier-app 1 -n adv-net-lab

# Delete all resources created by "multi-tier-app"
helm uninstall multi-tier-app -n adv-net-lab

# Download and build all subchart dependencies listed in Chart.yaml
helm dependency build

# Update Chart.lock file after modifying dependencies
helm dependency update

# Check for syntax or structural issues in the chart
helm lint .

# View the default values for the chart
helm show values .

# Get all deployed resources in a namespace
kubectl get all -n adv-net-lab

# View specific deployments
kubectl get deployment -n adv-net-lab

# See pods with their labels
kubectl get pods -n adv-net-lab --show-labels

# Show detailed information about all pods
kubectl get pods -o wide

```

## üß† Best Practices
- ```--dry-run --debug``` before applying upgrades

- Use subcharts for modular architecture

- Keep ```values.yaml``` under version control

- Use ```helm history``` and ```helm rollback``` to manage releases safely

- Use namespace scoping ```(-n)``` to isolate environments
